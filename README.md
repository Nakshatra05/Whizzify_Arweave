## Project Overview
Whizzify allows organizations to turn any session content into a gamified quiz experience. Using session materials, the platform automatically generates questions and rewards players in real-time based on their performance. By integrating rewards for correct answers, Whizzify motivates players to actively engage with content, transforming traditional learning into an immersive, onchain gaming experience.

## Problem
Engagement and reward management are two common hurdles:

- **Manual Quiz Creation:** Crafting relevant questions is often time-consuming and can lack variety.
- **Reward Management:** Manually tracking and rewarding participants can be cumbersome and prone to errors.
- **Participant Engagement:** Keeping learners engaged requires ongoing incentives and motivation.

## Solution
Whizzify brings a gaming approach to education with these features:

- **Automated Quiz Generation:** Upload session content, and Whizzify generates dynamic, gamified quiz questions.
- **Instant Onchain Rewards:** Rewards for correct answers are distributed instantly to playersâ€™ wallets on Arweave, ensuring fair and transparent incentives.
- **Easy Game Setup:** Organizations provide content and initial reward funds, and Whizzify creates an interactive learning game onchain.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain (Arweave):** For secure, permanent, and transparent reward distribution and gameplay tracking.
